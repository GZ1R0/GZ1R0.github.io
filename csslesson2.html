  <h2>What is a div element? <br> </h2>
  <p>The div element is like a bucket that groups sections of a webpage together.</p>
  <br>
  </div>

  <div class="question">
  <h2>What is one way you can identify or "target" a div element? <br> </h2>
  <p>A div can be identified or targeted in several different ways. We're focusing on classes for now. When you are calling a class in CSS, it will target every div with the same class. You can repeat styling across a website using the same class without having to repeat the CSS.</p>
  <br>
  </div>

  <div class="question">
  <h2>Why would you use a div element?<br> </h2>
  <p>To group content so it can be easily styled using the class or id attributes, marking a section of a document as being written in a different language (using the lang attribute), and so on.</p>
  <br>
  </div>

  <div class="question">
  <h2>What is a border property? <br> </h2>
  <p>The border property allows you to style the border around an element.</p>
  <br>
  </div>

  <div class="question">
  <h2>What are some of the different border properties? <br> </h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Border width</li>
      <li>Border color</li>
      <li>Border sides</li>
      <li>Rounded borders</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <br>
  </div>

  <div class="question">
  <h2>What is the difference between margins and padding? <br> </h2>
  <p>A margin is the spacing around an element from everything around it. The margin begins at the element's border. <br> Padding is the spacing content has from the element border. <br> Think of padding as someone wearing a big coat, and the margin as the space people give them.</p>
