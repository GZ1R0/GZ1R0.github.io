        <p>
        There are three main species of elephants — each adapted to its own habitat:
        </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>African Savannah Elephant:</strong> Found in open grasslands.</li>
        <li><strong>African Forest Elephant:</strong> Smaller, lives in dense forests.</li>
        <li><strong>Asian Elephant:</strong> Found across South and Southeast Asia.</li>
    </ul> <!-- I added the closing /ul tag because it tells the browser where the list ends, ensuring the webpage structure and formatting remain correct. -->
        <!--removed </li> as it was unecessary and no opening bracket beforehand-->
