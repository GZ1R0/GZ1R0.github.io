        <p>Elephants are the largest land mammals on Earth. They are highly intelligent and form strong family bonds led by a matriarch. They use their trunks for eating, drinking, and communication.

        <p>
        There are three main species of elephants — each adapted to its own habitat:
        </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>African Savannah Elephant:</strong> Found in open grasslands.</li>
        <li><strong>African Forest Elephant:</strong> Smaller, lives in dense forests.</li>
        <li><strong>Asian Elephant:</strong> Found across South and Southeast Asia.</li>
    </ul> <!--added </ul> because there was no ending bracket after the opening-->
        <!--removed </li> as it was unecessary and no opening bracket beforehand-->
    <div class="info-box">
        <p><strong>Fun fact: Elephant ears help regulate body temperature!</p>
